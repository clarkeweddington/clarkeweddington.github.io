        <p> This was a project I did alongside the Toronto Ad project. I created the project using Photoshop. Every choice was made keeping the tone of the city in mind. I chose these cities because I thought it would be interesting to play with their color palettes and tall tourist attractions. This set the tone exactly how I wanted it. Below are mockups of the ad, as well as a billboard version. I also created the billboard in photoshop and there is an additional example mockup included.</p>
